# Inline text elements

Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.

<!-- STORY -->

```html
<p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
<p><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
<p><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
<p><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
<p><u>This line of text will render as underlined</u></p>
<p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
<p><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
<p><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>
```

`.mark` and `.small` classes are also available to apply the same styles as `<mark>` and `<small>` while avoiding any unwanted semantic implications that the tags would bring.

While not shown above, feel free to use `<b>` and `<i>` in HTML5. `<b>` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while `<i>` is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.
