# Links

Links are very standard, and the color is preset to the Winding Tree pale blue color.

Additionaly, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` should be added to links containing `target="_blank"` as a precaution against reverse tabnabbing. For more information, please refer to this [article](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/).
