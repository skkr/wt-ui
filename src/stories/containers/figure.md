# Figure

Anytime you need to display a piece of contentâ€”like an image with an optional caption, consider using a `<figure>`.

Use the included `.figure`, `.figure-img` and `.figure-caption` classes to provide some baseline styles for the HTML5 `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements. Images in figures have no explicit size, so be sure to add the `.img-fluid` class to your `<img>` to make it responsive.

<!-- STORY -->

```html
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="..." class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure.">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A caption for the above image.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
